# GreatLakes_sentinel_sites
## Bioinformatics analysis of sequences generated from samples derived from Great Lakes sentinel sites project
This project aims to understand the roll of shipping in driving changes to biodiversity in the Great Lakes, by assessing long-term changes in diversity at sentinel sites (currently focused on Duluth-Superior Harbor) as well as diversity entering those sites via ballast water discharge. Biodiversity is analyzed using both morphological identification of specimens (elsewhere) and metabarcoding analysis of DNA extracted from environmental samples (here). The sequencing effort described here examines a variety of samples (port plankton, port benthos, ballast water plankton, etc.) using amplicon-based high throughput sequencing. We utilize multiple primer sets, primarily associated with the COI and 18S loci, to analyze metazoan communities, as well as primers targeting the 16S locus to describe microbial diversity. Bioinformatics analysis is conducted using QIIME2 installed on the USEPA's Atmos HPC cluster.
